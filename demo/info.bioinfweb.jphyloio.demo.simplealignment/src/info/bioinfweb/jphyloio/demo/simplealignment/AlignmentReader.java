/**
 * This is the <i>JPhyloIO</i> reader of this demo application that connects the readers available in <i>JPhyloIO</i> with the
 * business model of the application by extracting relevant data from the <i>JPhyloIO</i> event sequence and storing it in the 
 * application model.
 * <p>
 * Each application based on <i>JPhyloIO</i> needs to implement one such reader to support all available formats. The application 
 * can use this reader by calling {@link #read(JPhyloIOEventReader, Map)}.
 * <p>
 * Each method in this reader handles a sequence of events nested between a start and end event. although there are alternatives,
 * this is usually a good way to implement pull parsing. Each of these methods corresponds to a grammar node of the <i>JPhyloIO</i>
 * event sequence that can be found in the documentation of {@link JPhyloIOEventReader}.
