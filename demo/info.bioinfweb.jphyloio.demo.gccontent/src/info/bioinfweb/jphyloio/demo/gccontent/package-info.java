/**
 * This package contains a demo application that shows how to use <i>JPhyloIO</i> to read alignment data and process it in the fly.
 * <p>
 * This is the most basic example in the documentation of <i>JPhyloIO</i> and can be used as a starting point if you are new to
 * <i>JPhyloIO</i>. If you are planning to use the library in your own application, you should also look at the other more complex
 * demo applications.
