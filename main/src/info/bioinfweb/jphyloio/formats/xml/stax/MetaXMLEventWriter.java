/**
 * This writer can be used by applications already implementing iterator-based <i>StAX</i>-writing of metadata as an adapter 
 * to a {@link JPhyloIOEventWriter}. Instances of this class can be created directly inside a metadata writing method an an 
 * application's data adapter implementation, by passing the current event receiver to the constructor.
 * <p>
 * Attributes of a start document event are not processed, since it is not possible to write them at this position of the document.
 * <p>
 * This writer does not have the necessary information (e.g. predicate) to be able to write literal meta start and end events, 
 * therefore this has to be done by the application itself.
 * <p>
 * This writer does not manage namespaces of custom XML elements. The application needs to ensure that all used prefixes 
 * (either in any elements, attributes or character data) are properly declared within the custom <i>XML</i> 
 * (e.g. by adding {@link Namespace} events). Any methods of this writer changing the namespace mapping or obtaining information 
 * about it refer to the underlying writer. Note that if the default namespace is changed (either by setting a new default namespace or a completely 
 * new namespace context object) while this reader is on the top level of custom <i>XML</i>, it is possible that the literal meta 
 * end tag is written with the wrong default namespace (it would be written with a prefix then).
