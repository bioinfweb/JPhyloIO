/**
 * The root adapter interface to be used with {@link JPhyloIOEventWriter}s. Implementations model a document 
 * containing phylogenetic data, consisting of taxon lists, character matrices and trees or networks.
 * <p>
 * Application developers need to implement this and one or more of the references interfaces with an adapter
 * class, that allows {@link JPhyloIOEventWriter}s to access the business model of their application. 
 * (Alternatively the business model classes of the application may also implement these interfaces directly,
 * if suitable.) <i>JPhyloIO</i> offers a set of default implementations that could be used as superclasses of
 * application adapter implementations, which may reduce the workload in application development.
