/**
 * Event that indicates that a (predefined) definition of a character state set was found in the parsed file.
 * <p>
 * This event is not used to indicate subsets of states of certain characters as allowed e.g. in the SETS block 
 * of a Nexus file, but it defines all possible states of a character (although the concrete symbols are not 
 * enumerated by this event object).
 * <p>
 * This event may or may not occur in combination with {@link SingleTokenDefinitionEvent}, which 
 * might e.g. specify the gap character to used with the standard set, depending on the parsed file. 
 * <p>
 * JPhyloIO enumerates some standard token sets in {@link TokenSetType}. Some formats might define additional
 * sets which would be represented as {@link TokenSetType#UNKNOWN}. Application developers would have to rely on 
 * {@link #getParsedName()} in such cases, to determine the meaning.
 * <p>
 * If this token set should only be valid for some columns of the alignment, a character set (defined by a
 * {@link CharacterSetIntervalEvent}) will be referenced by the return value of {@link #getCharacterSetID()} (which
 * should not be mixed up with {@link #getParsedName()} which is just the string representation of this token
 * set as it was given in the parsed file.)
