/**
 * The main JPhyloIO interface to be implemented by all format specific event readers.
 * <p>
 * Events can be processed by subsequent calls of {@link #next()}. The event sequence generated by
 * implementing event readers must match the following 
 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form">EBNF</a>:
 * <pre>
 * Document = "DOCUMENT.START", {DocumentContent,} "DOCUMENT.END";
 * DocumentContent = OTUSet | Matrix | Tree | Network | CharacterSetPart | MetaInformation;
 * 
 * OTUSet = "OTUS.START", {OTUContent,} "OTUS.END";
 * OTUContent = OTU | MetaInformation;
 * OTU = "OTU.START", {MetaInformation,} "OTU.END";
 * 
 * Matrix = "ALIGNMENT.START", {MatrixContent,} "ALIGNMENT.END";
 * MatrixContent = TokenSetDefinition | SequencePart | CharacterSetPart | MetaInformation;
 * 
 * TokenSetDefinition = "TOKEN_SET_DEFINITION.START", {TokenSetDefinitionContent,} "TOKEN_SET_DEFINITION.END";
 * TokenSetDefinitionContent = SingleTokenDefinition | MetaInformation;
 * SingleTokenDefinition = "SINGLE_TOKEN_DEFINITION.START", {MetaInformation,} "SINGLE_TOKEN_DEFINITION.END";
 * 
 * SequencePart = "SEQUENCE.START", {SequencePartContent,}, "SEQUENCE.END";
 * SequencePartContent = "SEQUENCE_TOKENS.SOLE" | SingleSequenceToken | MetaInformation;
 * SingleSequenceToken = "SINGLE_SEQUENCE_TOKEN.START", {MetaInformation,} "SINGLE_SEQUENCE_TOKEN.END";
 * 
 * CharacterSetPart = "CHARACTER_SET.START", {CharacterSetPartContent,} "CHARACTER_SET.END";
 * CharacterSetPartContent = "CHARACTER_SET_PART.SOLE" | MetaInformation;
 * 
 * Tree = "TREE.START", {TreeOrNetworkContent,} "TREE.END";
 * Network = "NETWORK.START", {TreeOrNetworkContent,} "NETWORK.END";
 * TreeOrNetworkContent = Node | Edge | MetaInformation;
 * Node = "NODE.START", {MetaInformation,} "NODE.END";
 * Edge = "EDGE.START", {MetaInformation,} "EDGE.END";
 * 
 * MetaInformation = "META_INFORMATION.START", MetaContent, "META_INFORMATION.END";
 * MetaContent = {MetaInformation,} | {"META_XML_CONTENT.SOLE",};
 * </pre>
 * Additionally {@link CommentEvent}s ({@code "COMMENT.SOLE"}) may occur at any position in the stream, which 
 * is not shown in the grammar for greater clarity.
 * <p>
 * The documentation of {@link EventContentType} contains information on which event classes are used for which
 * event type.
