  /**
   * Reads a subsequence from an <i>JPhyloIO</i> event stream modeling contents of a literal metadata element into a string 
   * builder. The string representation of the modeled object is returned, even if it is not an instance of 
   * {@link CharSequence}. Encountered comment events are skipped and ignored.
   * <p>
   * This tool method can be called after a start event with the content type {@link EventContentType#LITERAL_META} was read 
   * from {@code reader} and will consume all following events including the respective end event with the type 
   * {@link EventContentType#LITERAL_META}. Note that this method may only be used if the sequence type of the literal 
   * metadata start event is {@link LiteralContentSequenceType#SIMPLE}.
   * <p>
   * Large strings maybe split among multiple content events by <i>JPhyloIO</i> readers. (See the documentation of
   * {@link LiteralMetadataContentEvent} for details.) A sequence of such events is concatenated into a single value returned 
   * by this method. Note that sequential reading of large strings that do not need to be in memory as a whole to be processed 
   * by the application is more efficient, if the application handles the content events directly. This method should be used 
   * with care if such cases are likely.
   * 
   * @param reader the <i>JPhyloIO</i> event reader providing the event stream
   * @return an instance of {@link StringBuilder} containing the string content or {@code null} if no content events were
   *         encountered before the literal metadata end event
   * @throws IOException if an I/O error occurs while reading from {@code reader} or if another content event was encountered
   *         although sequence was declared to be terminated by the last event (The latter case would indicate an invalid event
   *         sequence produced by {@code reader}, which is not to expect from a well-tested reader. If you encounter such 
   *         problems with a built-in reader from <i>JPhyloIO</i>, inform the developers.)
   * @throws NoSuchElementException if the event stream ends before a literal metadata end event is encountered (This should
   *         not happen, if {@code reader} produces an event stream according to the grammar defined in the documentation of
   *         {@link JPhyloIOEventReader}.)
